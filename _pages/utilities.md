#### LaTeX Beamer Template

I wrote a minimalist LaTeX Beamer template named `geamer`, which can be downloaded (along with the instructions) from its <a href="https://github.com/georgebwang/Geamer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub repository</a> or directly from <a href="/assets/media/geamer.tex" download>here</a>. Click the following link to see example slides: <a href="/assets/media/geamer-example.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Example</a>.

#### LaTeX Article Template

I prepared my own template package for writing articles using LaTeX, called `gemplate`. It includes all the common packages I use, as well as other configurations such as citations using BibLaTeX, font style, and document layout. The template (`.sty` file) can be downloaded from its <a href="https://github.com/georgebwang/Gemplate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub repository</a> or directly from <a href="/assets/media/gemplate.sty" download>here</a>. Click the link to see an example PDF output: <a href="/assets/media/gemplate-example.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Example</a>.
(The template is intended for the `article` document class, there is no guarantee that it will work in other document types.)
