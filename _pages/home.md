### Hello, I am excited to welcome you to my website

I am an Australian economist born in China. Chung-Yen Chu is the Wade-Giles romanization and presentation of my name in Chinese characters (朱中彦). Becoming an Australian citizen, I have been free on my journey towards the faith of Christianity. John C. Chu is my choice of cultural appreciation. My name in CCP’s pinyin was (Zhongyan Zhu).

I have publications in *The Journal of Finance*, *The Review of Financial Studies*, *Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis*, and *Management Science*. My research papers have won awards, including the William F. Sharpe Award, been presented at academic conferences, including the American Economic Association (AEA), American Finance Association (AFA), and Western Finance Association (WFA), and been featured in news media, including *Bloomberg*, *The Economist*, etc. My research proposals have been funded by the *Early Career Scheme* and *The Research Grants Council* Hong Kong.

I received my Ph.D. in Finance from Indiana University Bloomington (IUB) and an M.B.A. from the Saïd Business School at the University of Oxford. Joining Monash University in 2016, I was Dean's Commendation for Excellence in Research in 2020.

##### W﻿hat's new

*Updated on September 30, 2025*. Since the second half of 2021, I have been developing a second-generation model for the bank loan business: a wealth growth train on which agents share risks. The model has three extensions on the entrepreneur, the bank, and the household. In “**A Win-Win Loan Contract in Profit Uncertainty**,” I introduce a wedge of profit uncertainty between innovations and monopolistic profits, as described in Romer (1990). In “**Self-Healing Loan Maintenance**”,  I identify profits from good loans as the endogenous growth engine of the bank loan business. I define wealth accumulation as the permanent interest of households. The definition is intuitive because wealth is the source for consumption and investment, and the latter will grow a family’s wealth. Households withdraw their deposits because they feel unsafe with their deposit principal. The model of a wealth growth train offers a new explanation of financial instability in “**Great Recession and Systemically Important Banks**”.
