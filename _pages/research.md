#### Working Papers

**\[5] Self-Healing Loan Maintenance**: May 2025 

I identify a self-healing mechanism that governs the future of bank loans and household wealth. Self-healing refers to bank operations allocating profits from good loans to replace bad loans and make new loans. Because good loans vary relative to bad loans, self-healing can be fast or slow. Rapid healing guarantees an endogenous bank loan growth and household wealth accumulation. Insufficient good loans cause slow healing, which could lead to two undesirable outcomes. Worry about deposit safety, household withdrawals can cause bank liquidity shortages. In addition, excessive collateral damage could destroy bank capital. A bank becomes insolvent, and households panic.

**\[6]** **Fairness of Exchange in Loan Agreement**: with Zhanbing Xiao, new revision is expected in May 2025

We propose a fairness-of-exchange model based on new assumptions to revisit decisions on borrowing and lending made by entrepreneurs and banks. The bank loan business is modeled through two legally binding contracts where the bank is the lender in the loan contract and the borrower in the deposit contract. Our model differentiates why firms have no debt records. Firms with sufficient internal liquidity will not apply for external debt. Active credit screening will reject applicants desperate for external debt but historical operating income suggests that they are unqualified borrowers. Empirical evidence supports a weak borrowing demand during the Great Recession.

**\[7]** **Great Recession and Systemically Important Banks**: with Jitao Ou, April 2025

Poor maintenance decisions can explain why large banks acquired defaulted MBS assets before and during the Great Recession. We build the explanation on three pillars. First, large banks have extensive good loans that generate continuous profits. Second, corporate borrowing demand started to shrink before the Great Recession. Third, large banks speculate that dislocated prices will recover soon. Acquiring bad MBS assets with good collateral has unintended consequences. Large banks collectively become capital-constrained.   Poor maintenance decisions, instead of bank capital, are responsible for the financial instability. We identify a new spillover channel through which bank risks affect real-world companies.
