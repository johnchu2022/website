#### Working Papers

**\[5] Bank Asset Problem and Financial Stability:** December 2023, [[SSRN link](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4649359)]

I study a mechanism for developing banking crises from the bank asset side. The non-performing loans can break the good equilibrium of a perfectly diversified bank loan portfolio in Diamond (1984). Slow asset recovery divides households' opinions; withdrawal requests from a small proportion of early household depositors can lead to panic bank runs. The bank run mechanism differs from that in Diamond and Dybvig (1983). My model can explain the collapse and acquisition of Silicon Valley Bank in March 2023 and the systemic crisis in 2008.

We extend the entrepreneur’s debt contract in Holmström and Tirole (1998) by two assumptions. Banks are active; the entrepreneur’s income is stochastic. Our model can address two questions. Why do some, but not all, companies have access to credit lines? Why do companies that need credit lines the most not have access? Our empirical evidence confirms our model predictions.
